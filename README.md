Generation: 42 | Rules: B3/S23 | Alive: 89/800
Commands: start | pause | clear | random | speed | size | rules | stats | help | exit
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) or later
- Any terminal/console that supports ANSI colors (most modern terminals)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GameOfLife.git
   cd GameOfLife
   ```

2. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

3. **Run the game**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## 🎯 Usage

### Basic Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `start` | Begin/resume the simulation | `start` |
| `pause` | Pause the simulation | `pause` |
| `clear` | Clear all cells | `clear` |
| `exit` | Quit the game | `exit` |
| `help` | Show help message | `help` |

### Configuration Commands

| Command | Parameters | Description | Example |
|---------|------------|-------------|---------|
| `random` | `[probability]` | Fill grid randomly | `random 0.4` |
| `speed` | `[milliseconds]` | Set evolution speed | `speed 100` |
| `size` | `[width] [height]` | Resize grid | `size 60 30` |
| `rules` | `[birth] [survival]` | Set custom rules | `rules 3 23` |
| `stats` | - | Show statistics | `stats` |

### During Simulation

- **Spacebar** or **P** - Pause/resume
- **Q** or **Escape** - Return to command mode

### Example Session

```bash
> random 0.3          # Fill 30% of cells randomly
> size 50 25          # Set grid to 50×25
> speed 200           # Fast evolution (200ms between generations)  
> rules 36 23         # Use HighLife rules (B36/S23)
> start               # Begin simulation
# Press SPACE to pause, Q to return to commands
```

## 🧬 Game Rules

Conway's Game of Life follows simple rules that create complex, emergent behavior:

### Standard Rules (B3/S23)
- **Birth**: A dead cell with exactly **3** living neighbors becomes alive
- **Survival**: A living cell with **2** or **3** living neighbors stays alive  
- **Death**: All other cells die or remain dead

### Custom Rules
You can experiment with different rule sets using B/S notation:
- `B3/S23` - Classic Conway's Game of Life
- `B36/S23` - HighLife (creates replicators)
- `B368/S245` - Morley (creates interesting patterns)
- `B2/S` - Seeds (explosive growth)

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project demonstrates modern C# and .NET 8 best practices with clean architecture:

```
GameOfLife/
├── Models/
│   ├── Cell.cs           # Individual cell state and behavior
│   ├── Grid.cs           # 2D grid management and neighbor counting
│   └── GameRules.cs      # Configurable game rules (B/S notation)
├── Services/
│   ├── GameEngine.cs     # Core game loop and state management
│   └── DisplayService.cs # Console UI and rendering
├── Utilities/
│   └── InputParser.cs    # Command parsing and validation
└── Program.cs            # Entry point and dependency injection
```

### Key Design Patterns

- **Single Responsibility Principle** - Each class has one clear purpose
- **Dependency Injection** - Services are injected rather than instantiated
- **Async/Await** - Non-blocking game loop with responsive UI
- **Command Pattern** - User input parsing and execution
- **Composition over Inheritance** - Flexible, maintainable object relationships

## 🛠️ Technical Features

### Modern C# Features Used
- **Nullable Reference Types** for better null safety
- **Pattern Matching** with switch expressions  
- **Async/Await** for non-blocking operations
- **LINQ** for collection operations
- **Tuples** for multiple return values
- **Records** with value equality
- **Global Using** statements
- **Top-level programs**

### .NET 8 Features
- **Cross-platform** console applications
- **High-performance** collections (HashSet<T>)
- **CancellationToken** support for cooperative cancellation
- **Task.Run** for CPU-bound operations
- **Modern project file** format with implicit usings

## 🧪 Interesting Patterns to Try

Try these classic Game of Life patterns:

```bash
# Glider Gun (creates infinite gliders)
> clear
> # Set up specific pattern manually or use random with low probability
> random 0.1
> start

# Oscillators and Still Lives
> random 0.3
> start

# Explosive Growth  
> rules 2
> random 0.1
> start
```
